Lord of all the earth and all of heaven
I come and seek Your face
Worship You with all I have within me
Humbled by Your grace

Every heart, every nation
Every tribe, all creation
Will bow before Your presence and sing

You are high and lifted up
You are high and lifted up
And my soul sings hallelujah
To the Lamb, the Lamb of God
Hallelujah to the lamb

Lord of righteousness, You come in glory
Bright and morning star
And all my days I'll worship and adore You
Healer of my heart

And every prayer, every cry
You alone satisfy
We will lift Your praise again and again

You are high and lifted up
You are high and lifted up
And my soul sings hallelujah
To the Lamb, the Lamb of God

Majesty, majesty
Jesus Lamb of God
Majesty, majesty
Holy are You Lord

You are high and lifted up
You are high and lifted up
And my soul sings hallelujah
And my soul sings hallelujah

Majesty, majesty
Jesus Lamb of God
Majesty, majesty
Holy are You Lord

Sing it
Majesty, majesty
Jesus Lamb of God
Majesty, majesty
Holy are You Lord

Oh holy, holy
