Hey, hey, mama, said the way you move
Gonna make you sweat, gonna make you groove.
Oh, oh, child, way you shake that thing
Gonna make you burn, gonna make you sting.
Hey, hey, baby, when you walk that way
Watch your honey drip, can't keep away.

*Ah yeah, ah yeah, ah, ah, ah., Ah yeah, ah yeah, ah, ah, ah.

I gotta roll, can't stand still,
Got a flame in my heart, can't get my fill,
Eyes that shine burning red,
Dreams of you all thru my head.
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah.

Hey, baby, oh, baby, pretty baby,
Tell me what you do me now.
(Repeat) 
Didn't take too long 'fore I found out
What people mean my down and out.
Spent my money, took my car,
Started tellin' her friends she wants to be a star.
I don't know but I been told
A big legged woman ain't got no soul.

* Chorus 
All I ask for when I pray,
Steady rollin' woman gonna come my way.
Need a woman gonna hold my hand
And tell me no lies, make me a happy man.
