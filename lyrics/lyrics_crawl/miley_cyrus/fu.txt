(feat. French Montana)


[Intro]
Oh you broke my heart
I told you I was weak for love
But then you went around
And did what you wanted to do
And now I'm crying, crying

[Verse 1]
Ooh it seemed like everything was going fine
I found the love that I thought was gonna last
But then I accidentally saw a few things in your cell
I even LOL'd man I should've known
Why why you're doing what you do
You you might as well just tell the honest truth
See I'm not really down with this
This ain't no texting shit
Know I ain't got no biz, but it is what it is

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't really have much to say
I was over it the second that I saw her name

[Chorus]
I got two, ooh letters for you
One of them is F and the other one is U
Cause what you gotta do, is go get yourself a clue
Only two, ooh ooh letters to choose
One of them is F and the other one is U

[Post-Chorus: Miley Cyrus + French Montana]
Could've been this, could've been that
Would've been that, would've been that
You ain't with it, could've said that
Why you tripping, let me hear that
I ain't trying to argue no more
I do it all for you, you know you're my right eye
Baby let me show you

[Verse 2]
Oh I know what's been going on
Don't even try to act like mr super nonchalant
What makes you think I'll stick around
I'm not as stupid as you sound
And you sound really dumb right now
Auf Wiedersehen
I got a lot of nasty things blowing up in my head
But none of them are worth my time
You ain't even worth this rhyme
And I don't I don't give a [?]

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't really have much to say
I was over it the second that I saw her name

[Chorus]
I got two, ooh letters for you
One of them is F and the other one is U
Cause what you gotta do, is go get yourself a clue
Only two, ooh ooh letters to choose
One of them is F and the other one is U

[Post-Chorus]
Could've been this, could've been that
Would've been that, would've been that
You ain't with it, could've said that
Why you tripping, let me hear that
I ain't trying to argue no more
I do it all for you, you know you're my right eye
Baby let me show you

[Chorus]
I got two, ooh letters for you
One of them is F and the other one is U
Cause what you gotta do, is go get yourself a clue
Only two, ooh ooh letters to choose
One of them is F and the other one is U
