[CHORUS]
If you're looking for love
know that love don't live here anymore
He left with my heart
They both walked through that door, without me.
If your tryna find pity well you need to look somewhere else 
Cause I surely can't help you
I'm hurting myself
I've turned into someone else

[VERSE 1]
I used to believe love conquered all
Cause that's what I've seen in the movies
Come to find out its not like that at all 
You see, real life's much different

[PRE-CHORUS]
I don't wanna see you go
I only wanna see you smile
It hurts so much just thinking of
Felt like this for a while
I can't stand to see you fail
We tried, we lied
Cannot pretend to take us back to what we had
to make us feel alive again
Hold me close, Don't let me go, I hope
Tell me that now is not the end

[CHORUS]

...

I've turned into someone else

[VERSE 2]
I used to believe love conquered all
Cause that's what I felt when you held me
I thought you'd catch me if I fall
Fill me up when I'm empty

[PRE-CHORUS]
I don't wanna see you go
I only wanna see you smile
It hurts so much just thinking of
Felt like this for a while
I can't stand to see you fail
We tried, we lied
Cannot pretend to take us back to what we had
to make us feel alive again
Hold me close, Don't let me go, I hope

[BRIDGE x3]
Love is patient
Love is selfless
Love is hopeful
Love is kind
Love is jealous
Love is selfish
Love is helpless
Love is blind

Yeah Yeah
Oooh Yeah
I've turned into someone else
